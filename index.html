The students in our school have been asking for a new computer room for about 4 years.
After those 4 years we decided to gift our stuudents with a compute room, where they could do all of their homework on,because most of their homework involves using the laptop.
They have projects that involves you to reserch things,and it is very helpful to go into  the computer room to do it, and on fridays when our kids have free periods , they can go into the computer room to watch something or look at memes.
We also have settings which only allows them on certain things, because not everything in the internet is ok for their age. Our students love this computer room and spend their free periods in the computer room.
We like to let our student have the best privleges,so they can have a happy school life.

We have an a attendance app to let you parents know if your kid has safley reached school. We think our students attendance is very important
because there are important things they might miss if they are not at school at the right time. We also like to ensure our students saftey and we are sure you would like to know if your kid has arived safley or not.
We also give you reminders on the app if your student is late or not, and we also tell you where to pick up your child each day. We have worked on this app for years, because it is very helpful for teachers and parents.
There are many benifits of this app and we like our students to learn good habits like being on time.
We hope that you see the benifits of this app and we hope you enjoy this app, as much as we do.
